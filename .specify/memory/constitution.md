# Todo In-Memory Python Console App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
Every feature starts with a detailed Markdown spec in the specs/ folder (e.g., specs/add-task.md). Specs must be clear, comprehensive, and iterative. Refine specs until Qwen generates correct, functional code.

### II. AI Code Generation Only
Use Qwen exclusively for generating Python code. Provide Qwen with the spec, this Constitution, and any relevant context. Iterate by refining the spec if output is incorrect—do not edit code manually.

### III. Simplicity and Cleanliness
Follow PEP 8 standards, use meaningful variable names, modular structure, and proper error handling. Keep the app lightweight since it's in-memory (no persistence beyond runtime).

### IV. User-Centric Design
The console app should be intuitive, with clear prompts, input validation, and user-friendly output (e.g., numbered lists for tasks).

### V. Technology Constraints
Python 3.13+ with UV for dependency management. No external libraries unless essential (prefer standard library only). In-memory storage using lists or dictionaries—no databases or files.

## Feature Governance
Basic Features (Must Implement All):
1. Add Task: Prompt for title and description; assign unique incremental ID; store in memory.
2. Delete Task: List tasks; prompt for ID to delete; confirm removal.
3. Update Task: List tasks; prompt for ID and new title/description.
4. View Task List: Display all tasks with ID, title, description, and completion status (e.g., [x] for complete).
5. Mark as Complete: List tasks; prompt for ID to toggle completion status.

Each feature requires its own spec file in specs/. Specs must reference this Constitution and include: objective, user flow, inputs/outputs, edge cases, and example interactions.

## Repository Structure & Iterative Workflow
Repository Structure:
hackathon-todo/
├── Constitution.txt          # This file (or .md)
├── specs/                    # Feature specifications
│   ├── add-task.md
│   ├── delete-task.md
│   ├── update-task.md
│   ├── view-tasks.md
│   └── mark-complete.md
├── specs/history/            # Versioned specs for iteration tracking
├── src/                      # Python source code generated by Qwen
│   ├── main.py
│   └── task_manager.py       # Example modular file
├── README.md                 # Setup, run instructions, and demo guide
├── QWEN.md                   # Prompt templates and instructions for using Qwen
└── .gitignore

Use Git for version control; commit specs before generated code.

Iterative Workflow (Agentic Dev Stack Adaptation):
- Write spec → Generate plan with Qwen → Break into subtasks → Generate code with Qwen → Test and refine spec.
- Document all iterations in specs/history/ (e.g., versioned spec files like add-task-v1.md, add-task-v2.md).

## Governance
This Constitution serves as the supreme governing framework. All specifications, plans, tasks, and implementations must align with it. No manual coding is allowed—code must be generated by Qwen based on refined specs. Testing and Validation: Include basic manual testing instructions in README.md. Qwen-generated code must handle edge cases (e.g., empty list, invalid inputs, non-existent task IDs). Enforcement: All development must strictly comply with this Constitution. No manual code writing or editing allowed. Success is measured by: fully functional console app, clean spec-driven process, proper structure, and adherence to hackathon Phase I requirements. Amendment Process: This Constitution may only be amended if a critical need arises (e.g., to adapt to new hackathon clarifications). Amendments must be documented and justified.
