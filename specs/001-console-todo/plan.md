# Implementation Plan: Console Todo App

**Branch**: `001-console-todo` | **Date**: 2025-12-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-console-todo/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a console-based todo application that allows users to add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete/incomplete. The application will use in-memory storage with a menu-driven interface, following a modular architecture with separate concerns for data model, storage operations, and user interface. The application will be built using Python standard library only, with no external dependencies, and will strictly follow the spec-driven development approach with AI code generation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (as specified in constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Python standard library only (no external dependencies as per constitution)
**Storage**: In-memory using list of dictionaries or dataclass (as per constitution)
**Testing**: Manual testing based on acceptance criteria from spec (as per constitution)
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform console application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single console application (no web/mobile components)
**Performance Goals**: Fast response times for user interactions (under 1 second for each operation)
**Constraints**: No external libraries, in-memory only (no persistence), menu-driven interface
**Scale/Scope**: Single user console application, no concurrent users

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the constitution, the following principles must be adhered to:
- Spec-Driven Development: Following the detailed spec created in spec.md
- AI Code Generation Only: All code will be generated by Qwen, no manual coding
- Simplicity and Cleanliness: Following PEP 8 standards, modular structure, proper error handling
- User-Centric Design: Intuitive menu interface with clear prompts and user-friendly output
- Technology Constraints: Python 3.13+ with standard library only, in-memory storage

All requirements align with the constitution - no violations identified.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected as this is a console application with no frontend/backend separation needed. The modular approach will separate concerns into different Python modules (main.py for UI/menu, task_manager.py for data operations).

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Re-evaluated Constitution Check (Post-Design)

After completing the design phase, the following alignment with constitution principles is confirmed:

- Spec-Driven Development: Design fully aligns with the detailed spec in spec.md
- AI Code Generation Only: Architecture designed to support Qwen-generated code with no manual coding needed
- Simplicity and Cleanliness: Modular design with separate concerns (main.py for UI, task_manager.py for operations) following PEP 8 standards
- User-Centric Design: Menu-driven interface designed with clear prompts and user-friendly output
- Technology Constraints: Design uses only Python standard library with in-memory storage as required

No constitution violations identified in the final design.
