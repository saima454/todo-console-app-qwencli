# Feature Specification: Console Todo App

**Feature Branch**: `001-console-todo`
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "In-Memory Python Console Todo App – Phase I (Hackathon II) Target audience: Hackathon judges evaluating Phase I submission Focus: A clean, functional, user-friendly command-line Todo application with in-memory storage implementing all 5 Basic Level features Success criteria: Fully implements Add Task, Delete Task, Update Task, View Task List, and Mark as Complete Runs perfectly on Python 3.13+ with no external dependencies (standard library only) Tasks are stored in memory using a list of dictionaries or a simple class Unique auto-incrementing integer ID for each task Clear, intuitive menu-driven interface with numbered options Robust input validation and meaningful error messages (e.g., \"Task ID not found\") Displays tasks nicely with ID, title, description, and completion status ([ ] or [x]) Handles edge cases: empty list, invalid inputs, non-existent IDs Code is clean, PEP 8 compliant, modular (separate concerns like storage, UI, operations), and well-commented No manual coding – entire implementation traceable to specs and AI generation Constraints: In-memory only (no files, no database, data lost on exit) Use only Python standard library (no third-party packages) UV for virtual environment management (but no extra pip installs) Project must follow exact repository structure: Constitution.txt (or .md) specs/ folder with individual feature specs specs/history/ for iterations src/ with generated Python code (e.g., main.py, task_manager.py) README.md with setup and run instructions QWEN.md with prompt examples All code must be generated by Qwen based on refined specs – no manual edits allowed Task Model (strict): Each task must have exactly these fields: id: int (unique, auto-increment starting from 1) title: str (required, non-empty) description: str (optional, can be empty) completed: bool (default: False) User Interface Requirements: Main loop with menu: Add task View tasks Update task Delete task Mark as complete/incomplete Exit Clear prompts for user input After each operation, return to main menu Graceful exit on option 6 Not building: Persistence (save/load to file or DB) Priorities, tags, due dates, search, sorting (save for later phases) Multi-user support Any GUI or web interface Unit tests beyond basic manual verification Advanced error logging or config files Deliverables for Phase I: Public GitHub repo with clean history showing spec → code generation Working console app demo (under 90 seconds video) All specs and constitution committed"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Add New Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to add new tasks to my todo list so that I can keep track of things I need to do. The system should prompt me for a task title and optional description, assign a unique auto-incrementing ID, and store the task in memory with a default "not completed" status.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all other functionality. Without the ability to add tasks, the application has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding multiple tasks with different titles and descriptions, verifying they appear in the task list with correct IDs and completion status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am at the main menu, **When** I select "Add task", **Then** I am prompted for a title and optional description, and the task is added with a unique ID and "not completed" status
2. **Given** I have existing tasks, **When** I add a new task, **Then** the new task gets the next sequential ID number
3. **Given** I enter a title and description, **When** I submit the task, **Then** the task appears in the task list with the correct information

---

### User Story 2 - View All Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to view all my tasks so that I can see what I need to do. The system should display all tasks with their ID, title, description, and completion status in a clear, readable format.

**Why this priority**: This is a core function that users need to access regularly to understand their task list. It's essential for the application's primary purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding multiple tasks and verifying they all appear correctly in the list with proper formatting and status indicators.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple tasks, **When** I select "View tasks", **Then** all tasks are displayed with ID, title, description, and completion status ([ ] or [x])
2. **Given** I have no tasks, **When** I select "View tasks", **Then** I see an appropriate message indicating the list is empty
3. **Given** I have completed and incomplete tasks, **When** I view the list, **Then** completed tasks are clearly marked with [x] and incomplete with [ ]

---

### User Story 3 - Mark Tasks as Complete/Incomplete (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete or incomplete so that I can track my progress. The system should allow me to select a task by ID and toggle its completion status.

**Why this priority**: This is one of the core 5 Basic Level features that defines the todo application's purpose - tracking task completion status.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding tasks, marking them as complete/incomplete, and verifying the status changes are reflected when viewing the task list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have tasks in the list, **When** I select "Mark as complete/incomplete" and enter a valid task ID, **Then** the task's completion status toggles
2. **Given** I enter an invalid task ID, **When** I try to mark it complete, **Then** I receive an appropriate error message
3. **Given** I have a completed task, **When** I mark it as incomplete, **Then** its status changes from [x] to [ ]

---

### User Story 4 - Update Task Details (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to update the details of existing tasks so that I can modify titles or descriptions as needed. The system should allow me to select a task by ID and update its title and/or description.

**Why this priority**: This is one of the core 5 Basic Level features that allows users to maintain accurate task information over time.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding tasks, updating their details, and verifying the changes are reflected when viewing the task list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have tasks in the list, **When** I select "Update task" and enter a valid task ID, **Then** I can modify the title and/or description
2. **Given** I enter an invalid task ID, **When** I try to update it, **Then** I receive an appropriate error message
3. **Given** I update a task's details, **When** I view the task list, **Then** the updated information is displayed

---

### User Story 5 - Delete Tasks (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to delete tasks that I no longer need so that I can keep my todo list clean and relevant. The system should allow me to select a task by ID and remove it from the list.

**Why this priority**: This is one of the core 5 Basic Level features that allows users to manage their task list by removing completed or unnecessary items.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding tasks, deleting some of them, and verifying the remaining tasks are still accessible and the deleted ones are gone.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have tasks in the list, **When** I select "Delete task" and enter a valid task ID, **Then** the task is removed from the list
2. **Given** I enter an invalid task ID, **When** I try to delete it, **Then** I receive an appropriate error message
3. **Given** I delete a task, **When** I view the task list, **Then** the task no longer appears

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the task list is empty and the user tries to view, update, delete, or mark tasks?
- How does system handle invalid inputs (non-numeric IDs, empty titles, etc.)?
- What happens when a user enters an ID that doesn't exist?
- How does the system handle very long titles or descriptions?
- What happens when the user enters invalid menu options?
